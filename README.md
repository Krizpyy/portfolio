Assignment 4 - Building a Webpage
==================================

You will be creating a portfolio of your work in class so far. 

1. Edit `index.html` and change the `title`, `h1` and `p` elements to use your own name and information. 


2. Copy and paste your assignments into their respective `.js` files in the `/javascript  /` directory. 

3. Make the page your own by changing the CSS. You can do this by editing the `style.css` file. 

4. Try adding in an image or two into the `index.html` file. You'll need to copy your image into your assignment folder. Remember, images are written `<img src="path/to/image.jpg" />`. If you put the image in the same folder as your `index.html` file then your tag would look like `<img src="imageName.jpg" />`


5. Once you're done, you'll need to upload your assignment to GitHub.

* Open the GitHub app
* Select your portfolio project
* Type in a brief description of your change, and click the commit button
* Click Publish
