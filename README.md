Assignment 4 - Building a Webpage
==================================

You will be creating a portfolio of your work in class so far. 

1. Edit `index.html` and change the `title`, `h1` and `p` elements to use your own name and information. 


2. Copy and paste your assignments into their respective `.js` files in the `/javascript  /` directory. If you haven't completed an assignment yet, skip that file.

3. Make the page your own by changing the CSS. You can do this by editing the `style.css` file. 

4. Try adding in an image or two into the `index.html` file. You'll need to copy your image into your assignment folder. Remember, images are written `<img src="path/to/image.jpg" />`. If you put the image in the same folder as your `index.html` file then your tag would look like `<img src="imageName.jpg" />`. 


5. Once you're done, you'll need to upload your assignment to GitHub. Open the GitHub app, select your portfolio project, type in a brief description of your change, and click the commit button. Then click publish or sync in the upper right-hand corner. (If the GitHub app crashes when you try to open it, it might be that the permissions on your image are not set to `read`. To fix this, force quit GitHub, open Finder and locate the image, click once on the image, go to File > Get Info. A window will pop up. At the bottom, under Sharing & Permissions, select `Read only` for "everyone". Now try opening the GitHub app.)

6. After your assignment has been published to GitHub, go to your github page for that repository. It will be at https://github.com/username/portfolio where username is your username on GitHub.

7. Click on the settings button in the right sidebar. Change your repository name to username.github.io, where username is your GitHub username. Click the "rename" button to save your changes. 

You should now be able to view your webpage at the url username.github.io
