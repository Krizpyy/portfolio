Assignment 4 - Building a Webpage
==================================

You will be creating a portfolio of your work in class so far. 

1. Edit `index.html` and change the `title`, `h1` and `p` elements to use your own name and information. 


2. Copy and paste your assignments into their respective `.js` files in the `/javascript  /` directory. If you haven't completed an assignment yet, skip that file.

3. Make the page your own by changing the CSS. You can do this by editing the `style.css` file. 

4. Try adding in an image or two into the `index.html` file. You'll need to copy your image into your assignment folder. Remember, images are written `<img src="path/to/image.jpg" />`. If you put the image in the same folder as your `index.html` file then your tag would look like `<img src="imageName.jpg" />`. 

5. Once you're done, you'll need to upload your assignment to GitHub. Don't commit your changes yet. First you need to create a new branch. This lets the code know that you have your own unique updates to the code. There's an icon in the top of your GitHub app that if you over over it, says "Add a branch". Give the branch your name. 
6. Now you need to commit your changes to your branch. Make sure your branch is selected in the top dropdown menu. Type in a brief description of your change, and click the commit button. 

7. Next you need to submit a pull request. A pull request is anotehr way of saying "submit my branch of code." It send me your updates to the code so I can review them. You'll do this by clicking on the pull request button in the top right-hand corner. 

8. Your're done! No need to email me. GitHub notifies me when you submit your pull request.


Troubleshooting
----------------
If the GitHub app crashes when you try to open it, it might be that the permissions on your image are not set to `read`. To fix this, force quit GitHub, open Finder and locate the image, click once on the image, go to File > Get Info. A window will pop up. At the bottom, under Sharing & Permissions, select `Read only` for "everyone". Now try opening the GitHub app.
