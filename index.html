	<h1>Steven Orts</h1>
	<p> I truly love cars and motor racing. You could consider it an obsession. The speed, colors, sounds, and environments of races and race cars draw me in and inspire me. In my work, I focus on capturing the moment of time where this all falls into place in a specific frame. The graphic design on race cars, also known as the liveries, is what I find most interesting. Poster designs for racing are also something I commonly reference when working on a piece. My work revolves around the car and racing because to me it is the most beautiful form of artwork. As far as performance artwork goes, racing is at the very top for me. I have been interested in observing cars and racing as art for a little over 5 years now and have experimented in various mediums including sculpture, painting, photography, drawing, and digital works. The fact that my work is centralized around the speed and specific cars with their  respective time periods that follow, is what I feel makes it unique.</p>
