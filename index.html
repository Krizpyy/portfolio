	<h1>Kaisha Murzamadiyeva</h1>
	<p>I am a 19 year old student studying communication design at Parsons. I was born in Almaty, Kazakhstan but lived in several different locations like London, D.C, and The Hague. I really want to learn more about coding and get familiar with javascript, html, and CSS. Below, you can find my three assignments that I've finished over the course of three weeks.</p>
